# Updated Professional Profile #

This is the third version of my professional profile. I wanted to create a simpler web page that still retained eye catching animation. I spent a lot of time learning about CSS and implemented CCS grid, parallax effects, hover effects, overlays, and much more into this project. I tried utilizing nodemailer to allow users to send emails through the contact form but have been running into authentication issues with different email services. It's a work in progress as I need to spend more time reading over email service API documents. 

# Instructions #

1. Install npm packages
2. Enter 'npm start' in the command line to start the application

# Future developement #
This portfolio is a work in progress. Nodemailer authentication issues need to be resolved as well as additional styling for the modals. New projects will be added to the porfolio as they are built.

# Technology #
